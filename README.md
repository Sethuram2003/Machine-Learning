## Introduction
This repository serves as my personal learning journey through the world of machine learning. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch (where possible) or using popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`. The goal is to understand the underlying mechanics of these algorithms and share my learnings with the community.
